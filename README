To run the demo you need to have the following in your [hosts] file:

---%<--------------------------------------------------------------

    $ cat /etc/hosts | head -7
    127.0.0.1	localhost
    127.0.1.1	mp-ThinkStation-P320
    
    127.0.0.1 	login.cognitera.gr
    127.0.0.1 	app-1.cognitera.gr
    127.0.0.1 	app-2.cognitera.gr
    127.0.0.1 	app-1.cognitera2.gr


-------------------------------------------------------------->%---

NB: the last line in the /etc/hosts file printed above acts as a
    sanity test to ensure that cookie approach does not work on
    other domains (and thus enhance our confidence in the rigor
    of this demo and the sanity of this approach).
