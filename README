To run the demo you need to have the following in your [hosts] file:

---%<--------------------------------------------------------------

    $ cat /etc/hosts | head -7
    127.0.0.1	localhost
    127.0.1.1	mp-ThinkStation-P320
    
    127.0.0.1 	login.cognitera.gr
    127.0.0.1 	app-1.cognitera.gr
    127.0.0.1 	app-2.cognitera.gr
    127.0.0.1 	app-1.cognitera2.gr


-------------------------------------------------------------->%---

NB: the last line in the /etc/hosts file printed above acts as a
    sanity test to ensure that cookie approach does not work on
    other domains (and thus enhance our confidence in the rigor
    of this demo and the sanity of this approach).


NB2: make sure you start the development servers in the following order:

        1) cas
        2) app-1

This will ensure that the applications will run in the following ports as
expected by hardcoded values in the code:

        1) cas  : 3000
        2) app-1: 3001
